v. 0.1.0
	- This is the first beta version
	- Add a new parser to build systems out of PatchyParticles configurations
	- Add a method to the oxDNA topology Default's class to get the number of particles of species A
	- Add flexibility to the LAMMPS parser
	- Improve the flexibility of the cogli2 exporter
	- Fix a bug whereby parsers would not complain about unreadable files
	- Fix a bug whereby the structure factor observable would not take averages in the right way
	- Update the documentation

v. 0.0.3
	- Add the MapParticle filter, which takes a list of lists that specify the ids
	  of particles whose centre of mass will be used as a new particle
	- Add the FilterById filter, which takes a list of indexes and build systems 
	  where only those particles with a listed index are present
	- Add the `set_include_system` method to BaseTrajectory to selectively include 
	  systems in a trajectory 
	- Remove boost from the dependencies. boost::math remains a requirement only for
	  the BondOrderParameters observable
	- Improve the documentation coverage
	
v. 0.0.2
	- Add a test that checks the LAMMPS conf and topology parser and exporter
	- Add the write_topology and write_trajectory methods to BaseExporter
	- Remove Boost's `signal` from the dependencies
	- Fix compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 and add some documentation
	- Add an observable that computes the structure factor (and can optionally return a "destructured" structure factor)
	- Add an oxDNA exporter and improve the oxDNA parser
	- Dramatically improve the performance of System::available_index()
	- Add to the README updated info about the required libraries/packages
	- Add a mechanism to manage the version number
	- Bugfixing

v. 0.0.1
	- First release
