## Quality-of-life-changes

This is a list of things that will have to be changed as soon as I have some time to spare

* `FilterByType` can be implemented by using an *ad-hoc* `FilterByFunction`
* Use getters and setters to incapsulate members

## Architectural changes

* As of now, we can handle cuboid boxes with PBC only. We need to add a class hierarchy to support additional box types.

## Features to be added

* Angles, dihedrals etc. (impropers?) are not managed
* Add a mass member to particles
